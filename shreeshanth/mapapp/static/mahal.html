            Tipu and Hyder Mahal are two historic palaces located within the Vellore Fort in Tamil Nadu, India. While the palaces bear the names of the famous 18th-century rulers of Mysore, Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan, they were originally built by the Vijayanagara kings in the 16th century. The Mahals became associated with Hyder and Tipu after they were used to house Tipu's family during the British rule.
