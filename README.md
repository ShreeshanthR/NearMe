        <p align="justify" style="font-size: larger;">
        Gojra Fort is one of two hilltop fortifications built by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj near Vellore in 1678 to strategically bombard and capture Vellore Fort, which was being defended by the Bijapur army. Located on Naammam Malai hill with the Sajra Fort, Gojra Fort's name means "cute" in Marathi and it helped the Marathas to win the siege, leading to their control of Vellore for the next 30 years.  
Key aspects of Gojra Fort:
Purpose: It was a temporary but strategically vital fort built to gain a vantage point for bombarding the main Vellore Fort. 
Builder: Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj ordered its construction. 
Historical Context: The fort was built during the Maratha siege of Vellore in 1678, lasting fourteen months. 
Meaning: The name "Gojra" means "cute" in Marathi, while its counterpart, Sajra Fort, means "smart". 
Location: Situated on the Naammam Malai hill, east of Vellore City in Tamil Nadu, these forts commanded the surrounding lower Vellore Fort. 
Outcome: The successful construction and bombardment from Gojra and Sajra Forts led to the surrender of the Vellore Fort, after which the Maratha Empire strengthened its fortifications and held it for three decades.

            Tipu and Hyder Mahal are two historic palaces located within the Vellore Fort in Tamil Nadu, India. While the palaces bear the names of the famous 18th-century rulers of Mysore, Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan, they were originally built by the Vijayanagara kings in the 16th century. The Mahals became associated with Hyder and Tipu after they were used to house Tipu's family during the British rule.
